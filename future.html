<h1 id="colombia">Looking towards the future...</h1>

<p id="book">The idea for this site stemmed from the fact that I needed a theme for a graduate school project. But I am truly passionate about Colombian culture, as my maternal family is from Colombia. I truly would love to be able to keep up with this site so that people have a place to visit where they can learn about the culture. But unfortunately because of timing, I don’t know that I’ll be able to keep up with it as much as I would like, if at all. But if I had my wish, I would love to expand the site to include pages on more musical rhythms. Additionally I would like to add a page for each of the remaining thirty-one departments, so that visitors have a well-rounded view. I also wish there was a way that we really could offer actual classes to learn the Sanjuanero, and we would use the site to book the classes and to gage interest for further expansion. Furthermore, I’d use visitor feedback in order to know what visitors would like to see on the page, and start creating pages based on their wishes. Lastly, I would add more information to the links page, as I mentioned on there. Again, these are just wishes and I can’t promise that I’ll be able to follow through, but I invite you to continue to visit in order to find out if I was able to continue creating and adding information to a place that I am very proud of, regardless of the fact that it started as something I had to do for a class.</p>  

<p id="hope">To be quite honest, believe it or not, it was always a secret desire of mine to be able to promote Colombian culture, especially because of the negative perception that Colombia has always had. My hope is that I can somehow use this to show that such a beautiful country deserves a chance to be explored and admired. We obviously know that not everything is positive, but if we are completely honest with ourselves, every place has a not so positive side to it. Some more than others, but nothing is perfect because we don’t live in a bubble, but rather in an imperfect world. So what do you say? If I am able to continue this adventure, will you join me for a wild and wonderful ride through this amazing virtual world?</p>
