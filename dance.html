<br>

<!--The following text has been translated from Spanish-->

<div id="basic">
The first basic step is the walk.
To start, stretch the right leg, completely stretched out. 
Point the toe and bring down the heel and then bring the leg back.
The left, stretched, toe, heel.
Keep in mind that the foot comes out while always touching the floor, it should not be lifted.
Toe point, heel, toe point, heel.
Now we’ll do it in a more advanced form.
You’ll do right, left, advanced, one, two, three, four.
</div>
<br>

<div id="alright">
Alright, now we’ll continue with the second basic step, which is the &frac34; execution.
This consists of maintaining the toe point, heel.
We’ll do a long step and two pointed ones, equally as long and alternate right, left.
To this step, we’ll add the hand, which should always be at the height of the shoulders.
When we bring out the right leg, the hand comes out to the right.
When pointed, the hand comes in and falls to the left.
</div>
<br>

<div id="as">
As we see, she does very traditional movements, with little technique.
Now, you’ll do the same thing, but with closed legs, without crossing them too much.
Now, flex a bit, flex, flex and then add the hop.
Flex, hop, flex, hop.
Now, hips to the right and then to the left, right, left.
Now you’ll add the hands at the height of the shoulders, you can bring then in just a bit.
Look to one side and then to the other.
Flex, hop, flex, hop.
Always close your legs, close them. 
Look to the right, to the left.
Right, left.
