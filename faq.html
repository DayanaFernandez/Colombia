<div id="do">Q: Do colors matter for the clothing?</div>
<div id="really">A: Not really, although the lady’s blouse is always white with the same colored trim that is on the skirt, although as stated on our home page, the skirt can come in many different colors. For the gentleman’s attire, it always consists of black pants, a white shirt, a red bandana, and a straw hat. The attire has always been the same when the dance is done in formal settings.</div>
<br>

<div id="what">Q: What is the cost of the clothing?</div>
<div id="about">A: About 600.000 Colombian pesos, which is approximately &#36;200.00 U.S. dollars.</div> 
<br>

<div id="why">Q: Why is the Sanjuanero done barefoot?</div> 
<div id="dance">A: The dance is done this way because it is one of many that has roots back in times of slavery, where the slaves would be out in the fields with shackles around their ankles, so they couldn't move very far and they had no shoes.</div>
<br>

<div id="more">Q: Are there more variations of the Sanjuanero?</div>
<div id="each">A: Each region of Colombia has its own cultural dance and they borrow some influence and a couple steps, but each dance is unique and stands alone.</div>
<br> 

<div id="is">Q: Is the dance only done by adults?</div>
<div id="fact">A: Absolutely not! In fact, just as there is an adult celebration, the little ones get their own as well, where they also get to compete in their own pageant and performing the dance well is also a requirement for them to have a chance at winning.</div>
