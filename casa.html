<h1 id="casa">Welcome to Casa Huilense!</h1>
<img src="dayanafulldress.jpg" alt="picture in full dress" class="align-center dayanafulldress" />

<p id="nonprofit">We are a nonprofit organization, located in Towson, MD and dedicated to promoting Colombian folkore through music and dance. Since we are a small and new organization, just founded this year, our focus for this site right now is the Sanjuanero. But in the future we truly hope to be able to expand to many other rythyms. Why did we decide to focus on Colombian folklore? Well, our family is originally from Colombia, and we miss it, so this is a way to stay connected. How did this come about you ask? We have a big family so those of us who are local decided we would come in on this project together, and thus Casa Huilense was born! Our vision is to share our passion for Colombian folklore so that you are able to see what makes it so special. Therefore, our main goal is for you to have fun while you're here, while also walking away with some knowledge about a beautiful culture. We will strive to update the site on a monthly basis so that you have the best experience possible every time you visit, which we hope will be frequently! As for your inquires, we will make every effort to respond within a 72-hour period. Please visit our <a href=http://www.dayanafernandez.com/contact.html>Contact Us</a> page to send us comments, as well as to sign up for email updates.</p>

<p id="anselmo">The Sanjuanero melody was written in 1936 by Anselmo Dur&aacute;n Plazas, with lyrics by Sof&iacute;a Gait&aacute;n de Reyes. It is used as the anthem to the festival of “El Reinado Nacional del Bambuco” which is a pageant held in Nieva, Huila, Colombia (South America) where young (single, but over 18) ladies compete (one from each of the 32 departments of Colombia) to become the national queen. This is celebrated every year, in June, during the Saint Peter celebration. Please visit our <a href=http://www.dayanafernandez.com/pageant.html>National Peageant</a> page to learn more. One of the requirements in order for them to compete is that they have to be able to dance the Sanjuanero very well. The story behind the dance is that it was used as a way for men to ask women to be their girlfriend. The ladies have to wear a blouse and skirt like the one you see above, although it can be many different colors and the flowers can be painted on, as seen in the picture  or glued and sewn on, as seen in the video. Take note that both dancers are barefoot. Please visit our <a href=http://www.dayanafernandez.com/faq.html>FAQs</a> page for further information on the cost of the ladies' attire, information on the gentleman’s attire, and the reason behind the dance being performed in bare feet. In addition, please visit our <a href=http://www.dayanafernandez.com/dance.html>Learn the Sanjuanero</a> page to learn how to perform the dance.</p>
