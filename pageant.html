<h1 id="casa">More about the national pageant and festival...</h1>

<p id="summer">We’ve previously mentioned that the Sanjuanero is the main dance that needs to be learned by contestants that participate in Neiva’s main pageant. Now we want to talk about the bigger national festival that the pageant is actually a part of. The festival is a month-long celebration that occurs every June. All of the activities celebrate the cultural heritage and the diversity of the Colombian people. Every department of Colombia sends a candidate to participate in the pageant. This portion resembles the various pageants that we see here in the U.S. The interesting part is that this festival also includes a parade around Neiva, complete with decorated floats, like the one you see in the photo below. Each candidate can choose whether they want to ride in their float in cultural dress on in a bathing suit. The climate is very hot, so typically you will see them in bathing suits, but there are some brave souls that whether the heat and the long parade route in order to look their best. As a kid, I would travel to Colombia every summer and watching this parade was the best part of the trip, and even now, I still get pretty giddy watching it, although I no longer travel every summer.</p>

<p id="parade">There is a part of this parade that still makes me uneasy and it’s the horseback riders that are always included at the very end. Seeing all the gorgeous animals is pretty impressive, but many times the riders are under the influence of alcohol, so you never know if they are going to do something that will upset the animals and have them suddenly behave erratically and that could cause serious harm to the viewing public, because although the street is corded off, people do stand right up again the cords, which is close enough to be seriously injured if the animal did go wild.</p>

<p id="tio">These last two pictures are of my uncle and his sister-in law doing a version of the sanjuanero. You’ll notice that although her clothing is similar, it’s not the big skirt and colorful blouse that you’ve seen. That’s because different versions are done with different types of dress. Also, if you notice, they are not barefoot because in this version, that type of simple lace-up sandal is worn, for both females and males. Although, people modify things to their comfort level, because for example, she’s got her hair in braids, but if you think back to my pictures, I chose not to wear the colorful headpiece, even I do have one, that came with the outfit.</p>
