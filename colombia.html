<h1 id="colombia">Let's learn about Colombia!</h1>

<h2 id="flag">Flag</h2>

<img src="colombianflag.jpg" alt="flag" class="align-center colombianflag" />
<p id="stripes">The Colombian flag is made up of three horizontal stripes, which are yellow, blue, and red, respectively. The width of the yellow stripe is equal to the width of the blue and red stripes combined.</p> 

<p id="meaning">There are two popular meanings of the colors. The first one says that the yellow stripe represents Colombia's gold and wealth, its diverse nature and its people. Blue represents Colombia's shores, seas and rivers, as well as its skies. Red represents the blood shed for Colombia's independence and its people's effort. It also represents determination and perseverance, and that although the Colombian people have had to struggle, we have thrived.</p>

<p id="people"> The second popular belief is that yellow represents sovereignty and justice. Blue represents loyalty and vigilence and red represents the victories during the battle for Colombia's independence. Colombia gained its independence from Spain on July 20, 1810.</p> 

<h2 id="anthem">National Anthem</h2>

<p id="poem">The anthem was originally a poem written by former Colombian president Rafael Núñez. José Domingo Torres, an actor from Bogotá, discovered it and asked a friend, opera singer Oreste Sindici, to set it to music. It was adopted as the national anthem on October 28, 1920. 

<p id="fact">An interesting fact is that there is a country-wide mandate that the anthem be broadcast both on TV and radio on a daily basis, both at 6 am and 6 pm.</p>

<p id="chorus1">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus2">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza1">I: The dreadful night has ceased. Sublime Liberty beams forth the dawn of her invincible light. All of humanity that groans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the cross.</p>

<p id="chorus3">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus4">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza2">II: "Independence!" shouts the American world; The land of Columbus is bathed in heroes' blood. But this great doctrine: "The king is not sovereign", resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion.</p>

<p id="chorus5">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus6">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza3">III: The Orinoco's bed is heaped with plunder, of blood and tears, a river is seen to flow. In Bárbula neither souls nor eyes, know whether admiration to feel or fear to suffer.</p>

<p id="chorus7">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus8">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza4">IV: On the shores of the Caribbean, a famished people fight, preferring horror to fickle health. Oh yes! from Cartagena, heavy is the hardship, and death's rubble her virtue disdains.</p>

<p id="chorus9">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus10">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza5">V: From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, from every sprig a hero was crowned undefeated. Soldiers without armor won the victory; their virile spirit served them as a shield.</p>

<p id="chorus11">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus12">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza6">VI: Bolívar crosses the Andes bathed by two oceans, swords as though sparks flash in Junín. Indomitable centaurs descend to the plains,and a premonition begins to be felt, of the epic's end.</p>

<p id="chorus13">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus14">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza7">VII: The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho loudly thunders, as in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is first felt, from the American sky forming a pavilion.</p>

<p id="chorus15">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus16">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza8">VIII: In agony, the Virgin tears out her hair, and bereft of her love, leaves it to hang on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin.</p>

<p id="chorus17">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus18">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza9">IX: Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes bursting forth; a constellation of cyclops the night did brighten. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought.</p>

<p id="chorus19">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus20">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza10">X: But it's not complete glory to defeat in battle, the arm that fights
is encouraged by truth. For independence alone the great clamour doesn't silence;
if the sun shines on everyone, justice is liberty.</p>

<p id="chorus21">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus22">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="stanza11">XI: Of men the rights Nariño's preaching, the soul of struggle was prophetically taught. Ricaurte in San Mateo, in atoms flying, "Duty before life," with flames he wrote.</p>

<p id="chorus23">Chorus: Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>

<p id="chorus24">Oh, unfading glory! Oh, immortal joy! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates.</p>
