<h1 id="colombia">Welcome to our musical world!</h1>

<p id="music">Here you will find information on musical rhythms and songs that are considered emblematic of Colombian culture. I can't dance, but I confess to not being able to stay still when I hear the music. I urge you to take a listen....can you manage to stay still and not want to get up and move to the music or at least snap your fingers along with it? I'll bet the answer is no! 

<p id="point">I know that up to this point, all the videos have been translated, but I need to apologize as I decided not to do so for this page. Some of these songs have made up words that I can't translate. So in order to prevent the feeling of disrespecting the significance, I will simply provide a short description and mention why I decided to include each one.</p>

<h2 id="casa">Checo Acosta</h2>

<img src="dayanacheco.jpg" alt="checo" class="align-center dayanacheco" />

<p id="acosta">I met Mr. Checo Acosta in August of 2010 when he gave a concert in Silver Spring, MD. It was an awesome moment because I’ve been a fan for a long time, so it was an honor to be able to meet him in person. I chose to include one of his songs here because he focuses primarily on cumbia, which is one of the prominent musical rhythms in Colombia. This is also one of my favorite songs because it talks about life being joyous and the fact that we should always celebrate the happy moments. It also talks about some of Colombia's celebrations.</p>

<h2 id="arroyo">Joe Arroyo</h2>

<p id="joe">Joe Arroyo’s “En Barranquilla Me Quedo” is one of Colombia’s most famous salsa songs. Mr. Arroyo was a legend in his own right and he was considered Colombia’s salsa great and often referred to as Master Joe Arroyo. He decided to compose the song because he was from a different part of Colombia and Barranquilla was the city that opened its arms to him at age 14 and his music later on, so he wanted to pay homage to it. The song talks about his feelings toward the city that embraced him, what it means and represents for him. I chose this one because it talks about being proud of your heritage and never forgetting where you’re from, but also being grateful for the opportunities that life presents to you and embracing them.</p>

<h2 id="cali">Grupo Niche</h2>

<p id="niche">Grupo Niche’s “Cali Pachanguero” is another famous salsa song, but this time by one of Colombia’s most famous salsa groups. The song also talks about being proud of being from Cali, but more from the point of describing the city and its people. This is exactly the reason I decided to include it here.</p>

<h2 id="carlos">Carlos Vives</h2>

<p id="vives">Carlos Vives’ La Tierrra del Olvido” is one of Colombia famous vallenatos, which is another one of Colombia’s central musical rhythms. The original version came out in 1995, but I decided to showcase the 20th anniversary version because it was done by a compilation of Colombian artists in different iconic locations of Colombia. The song talks about love and finding refuge on a forgotten land.</p>
